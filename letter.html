Disclaimer: I'm writing this letter in my voice to make it more personal.

Dear Shaquan,
  I don't even know where to start lowkey, sorry if anything is confusing. Since we got back together you've been telling me 
  stuff about your regrets and how you feel but i haven't been that open with you yet, which im gonna do now. I've missed you so much since november
  even though i've been through so many emotions (anger, sadness, disbelief, contentment, confusion, regret etc.) it all came back down to me loving you so much.
  I thought i was getting better but i couldn't go a single day without thinking about you fr. Then on last week wednesday night I went to bed and dreamt about you,
  thats not the first time it happened since we broke up though but it was different this time,  i woke up and couldn't get you out of my head AT ALL. Then smt 
  else happened but i wanna tell you on call so i can see your reaction lol. Anywho, I decided to reach out because i just needed to hear your voice, i wasn't
  even sure if you would answer but when you did i kinda chickened out and just told you to call me back, i was waiting a while then said maybe you didn't want to
  talk to me. I'm so happy we got a chance to talk tho, i've missed you so much, just thinking about it rn is making me tear up. I have some of the biggest 
  regrets and they're lwk eating me alive and i need you to know how sorry i am for saying all those things to you, even if you forgive me i dont think i could
  ever forgive myself and i hate myself for it fr. I love you so much and now i have another chance with you and i'm not planning to mess this up. I'm going 
  to cherish every moment we have together, i can't afford to hurt you again. I hope for this second chance to be better than the last, we can grow together, 
  spiritually and emotionally. I'm looking forward to being by your side for the rest of my life Shaquan. You're turning 20!! i've known you since you were 16, 
  you grew up so fast. I love you so much and i can't wait to see the day your hair turns gray. Happy Birthday sweetheart.

Forever and Always yours,
  Rohalia.
  P.S: if i have more to say i will tell you myself :)
